# Fix Filename Encodings
Simple program to fix garbled file names when a zip is made in JP locale but extracted in another locale.

#### [Download Link](https://github.com/wcko87/fix-filename-encodings/releases)

## Usage
This is a script to fix garbled encodings of FILE NAMES. It does not affect the contents of the files. This script is used when you have extracted a zip file in the wrong locale.
- **[Display Fixes]** will display the list of encoding fixes this program will make.
- **[Fix Encodings]** will carry out the actual encoding fixes. It will also display the encoding fixes made.

Note: If you enter the path to a folder, it will fix the encoding of every file (recursively) within the folder.
